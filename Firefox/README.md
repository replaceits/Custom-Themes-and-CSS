# Firefox
### Installation
Simply place the file userChrome.css into `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\znw9o4pc.default\chrome\` and restart firefox.

In addition to the `userChrome.css` file I use the `FT DeepDark` theme, `New Tab Override` (can be skipped) extension, and the `Classic Theme Restorer` extension in order to get the look right.
